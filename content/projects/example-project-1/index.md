## Overview

This research program investigates the fundamental mechanical interactions between unit load components — pallets, corrugated boxes, and products — during warehouse racking storage and transportation. Understanding these interactions is critical for optimizing packaging design, reducing material usage, and preventing product damage.

## Key Contributions

- Developed friction-driven finite element models to simulate load bridging effects in warehouse racks
- Created Gaussian process surrogate models for rapid prediction of unit load performance
- Investigated the effect of pallet stacking patterns on unit load bridging behavior
- Studied the impact of pallet overhang on box compression strength

## Methods

Our approach combines computational modeling (FEM, machine learning surrogates) with physical testing to create predictive tools that packaging engineers can use to optimize unit load designs without expensive trial-and-error prototyping.
