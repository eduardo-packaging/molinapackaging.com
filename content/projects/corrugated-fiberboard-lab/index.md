## Overview

As part of the Center for Packaging and Unit Load Design at Virginia Tech, I established and manage the only IKEA-certified corrugated fiberboard testing laboratory in North America. This facility serves both research and industry needs, providing standardized testing and certification services.

## Capabilities

The laboratory evaluates and certifies performance properties of corrugated fiberboard for manufacturers and end users, including:

- Edge crush test (ECT)
- Burst strength testing
- Flat crush testing
- Moisture content analysis
- Board composition and flute profiling
- Custom performance testing per client specifications

## Student Training

The lab provides hands-on training opportunities for students in the Packaging Systems and Design program, giving them direct experience with industry-standard testing methods and quality assurance procedures.

## Industry Partnerships

The lab serves corrugated board manufacturers, converters, and end users across North America, providing independent third-party testing and certification services aligned with international standards.
