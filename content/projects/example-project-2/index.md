**Last-Mile Grocery Delivery** — Investigating operational challenges and packaging requirements for grocery delivery in suburban environments, including temperature-sensitive products and delivery efficiency.

**Direct-From-Store Deliveries** — Analyzing consumer preferences and operational execution for store-based fulfillment models in a global context.
