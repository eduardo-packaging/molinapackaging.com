abstract: 'A corrugated box''s compression strength can easily be affected by how the box is used, including pallet overhang which reduces a box''s effective compression strength (BCT). The specific impact of a given amount of overhang on BCT remains poorly defined. In the current study, a range of box sizes and constructions were examined in over a dozen single-side overhang configurations and five adjacent-side overhang scenarios to identify key factors contributing to loss of strength, producing an average reduction in BCT of up to 40%. These results indicated that common safety factors fit well with adjacent overhang scenarios but overestimate single-side overhang scenarios. We developed a range of multiple linear and nonlinear regression models, estimating the change in a box''s compression strength due to overhang compared with a no-overhang scenario. The impact of overhang on the short and long sides, whether overhang exists on a single side or adjacent side, box size, and board type were all statistically significant. This work also indicates the need for further research refining the first-order model and extending it to other materials, box sizes, and box aspect ratios.'
